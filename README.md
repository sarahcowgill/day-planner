# day-planner

In this project I made a work day planner with a schedule from 9am to 5pm using Javascript and Moment.js. The user will be able to fill out each hour of their desired activity and be able to click save. This data should show up in local storage. The user can simply delete and rewrite any time slot they would like if they would like to change their schedule. The project can be viewed here: https://sarahcowgill.github.io/day-planner/
